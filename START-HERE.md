# 📚 Event Ticketing Platform - Documentation Index

Welcome! This project has been fully converted from Convex to a Microservices Architecture.

## 🚀 QUICK START (2 Minutes)

**Don't read everything! Just do this:**

1. **Check MongoDB is running**:

   ```bash
   mongod --version
   ```

2. **Run the project**:

   ```bash
   ./start-all.sh
   ```

3. **Wait 15 seconds, browser opens automatically**

4. **Register** → **Create Event** → **Book Tickets** → **Done!**

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner:

1. Read **TRANSFORMATION-SUMMARY.md** to understand what was built
2. Follow **SETUP-GUIDE.md** to run the project
3. Play with the app (register, create events, book tickets)
4. Check **ARCHITECTURE-VISUAL.md** for visual understanding

### Intermediate:

1. Read through **README-MICROSERVICES.md** for technical details
2. Explore the code in `frontend/src/services/api.js`
3. Look at backend routes in each service's `src/routes/` folder
4. Understand the authentication flow

### Advanced:

1. Study inter-service communication patterns
2. Review database models in `src/models/` folders
3. Modify and extend features
4. Deploy to production (Docker/Kubernetes)

---

## 🔥 Common Commands

### Start Everything:

```bash
./start-all.sh
```

### Start Individual Services:

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd auth && npm run dev

# Terminal 2
cd event && npm run dev

# Terminal 3
cd ticket && npm run dev

# Terminal 4
cd payment && npm run dev

# Terminal 5
cd frontend && npm start
```

### With Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d           # Start all
docker-compose logs -f         # View logs
docker-compose down            # Stop all
```

### Check Service Health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Auth
curl http://localhost:3002/health  # Event
curl http://localhost:3003/health  # Ticket
curl http://localhost:3004/health  # Payment
```

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

After starting the project, verify these work:

- [ ] Can access http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Can register a new user
- [ ] Can login with credentials
- [ ] Can create a new event
- [ ] Event appears in "Events" page
- [ ] Can click on event to see details
- [ ] Can book tickets (3-step process)
- [ ] Booking appears in "My Orders"
- [ ] Created event appears in "My Events"

If all checkboxes ✅, everything works!

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. **Can't start services?**

   - Check: Is MongoDB running?
   - Check: Are ports 3000-3004 available?
   - Read: SETUP-GUIDE.md → Troubleshooting section

2. **Services crash?**

   - Look at terminal logs for errors
   - Check health endpoints
   - Restart MongoDB

3. **Frontend errors?**

   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Check Network tab for failed requests
   - Verify all backend services are running

4. **Database errors?**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Check connection strings in .env files
   - Verify MongoDB is on localhost:27017
