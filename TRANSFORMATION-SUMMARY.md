docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Manual (5 Terminals)

Terminal 1: `cd auth && npm run dev`
Terminal 2: `cd event && npm run dev`
Terminal 3: `cd ticket && npm run dev`
Terminal 4: `cd payment && npm run dev`

## 🎓 ARCHITECTURE EXPLANATION

### How Services Communicate:

```
Frontend (React)
    ↓ HTTP Request
Auth Service
    ↓ Creates Session
    ↓ Returns Cookie
Frontend stores cookie
    ↓
Frontend calls Event Service
    ↓ Includes cookie
Event Service verifies with Auth Service
    ↓ Cookie valid?
Returns events
```

### Booking Flow:

```
1. User selects tickets → Frontend
2. Frontend → Ticket Service: Create order
3. Ticket Service → Event Service: Get event details
4. Ticket Service: Creates order
5. Frontend → Payment Service: Process payment
6. Payment Service: Simulates payment (90% success)
7. Payment Service → Ticket Service: Update order status
8. Frontend shows success/failure
```

## 💡 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM CONVEX

| Aspect         | Convex (Before)        | Microservices (Now)  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Backend**    | Serverless functions   | Express.js REST APIs |
| **Database**   | Convex hosted DB       | MongoDB (local)      |
| **Real-time**  | Built-in subscriptions | HTTP requests        |
| **Deployment** | Cloud-only             | Can run anywhere     |
| **Scaling**    | Automatic              | Manual/Docker        |
| **Cost**       | Pay per use            | Free (self-hosted)   |
| **Control**    | Limited                | Full control         |
| **Learning**   | Convex-specific        | Standard web dev     |

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: Services won't start

✅ **Solution**: Check if MongoDB is running

### Issue: Port already in use

✅ **Solution**: Kill the process or use different ports

### Issue: Cannot connect to database

✅ **Solution**: Verify MongoDB is running on localhost:27017

### Issue: Login doesn't work

✅ **Solution**: Make sure Auth service started first

### Issue: npm install fails

✅ **Solution**: Delete node_modules and try again

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### To Run Now:

```bash
# Make sure MongoDB is running, then:
./start-all.sh
```

### To Learn More:

- Read SETUP-GUIDE.md for detailed instructions
- Check each service's code to understand the flow
- Experiment with creating events and bookings

### To Extend:

- Add email notifications
- Add real payment gateway (Stripe/PayPal)
- Add event images upload
- Add ticket QR codes
- Add event search
- Add user reviews

---

## 📞 NEED HELP?

Check the logs in each terminal window for errors. Each service has detailed logging with Winston.

Health check endpoints:

- http://localhost:3001/health
- http://localhost:3002/health
- http://localhost:3003/health
- http://localhost:3004/health

## 🏆 CONGRATULATIONS!

Your Event Ticketing Platform is now fully functional with microservices architecture!

**No Convex. No Cloud. Just pure microservices running locally!**

Enjoy building! 🎉
